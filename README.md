# Spyware Detection Webpage

This is a simple **Spyware Detection** webpage that simulates scanning a URL for malware. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a URL and get a random result indicating whether malware was detected or not.

---

## Features

- Responsive design with a background image.
- Input form to enter a URL for scanning.
- Simulated scan result that randomly shows either "MALWARE DETECTED!" or "NO MALWARE DETECTED".
- Results are displayed with appropriate colors (red for malware detected, green for clean).
- Clean and simple UI with transparency effects.

---

## How It Works

1. The user enters a URL in the input box.
2. When the **Scan for Malware** button is clicked, the page simulates a scan with a 1-second delay.
3. It randomly decides if malware is detected (50% chance).
4. Displays the result message accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How to Use

2. Enter a URL in the input box.
3. Click the **Scan for Malware** button.
4. Wait for the result message to appear.

## Notes

- This project **does not perform real malware detection**; it only simulates scanning behavior for demonstration purposes.
- The image source for the main detection image is currently set to a local file path. To make the project fully portable, replace it with an online accessible image URL or add the image to the project directory.
